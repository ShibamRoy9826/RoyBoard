# RoyBoard 

A Custom wired mechanical keyboard that I made by myself! This is a part of [hackclub's](https://hackclub.com/) [hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/) event, where teenagers like me make their own macropads and keyboards.

## Features 😎

- Includes RGB lights (not per key RGB)
- Has 1 rotary encoder, but has multiple functions
- Consists of 81 keys in total, a 75% keyboard
- Controllable RGB light brightness

## What tools did I use? 🪛

- [kiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) : For PCB designing
- [shapr3d](https://www.shapr3d.com/) : For Case designing

## Firmware 🖥️

As of now, the firmware is untested, and is written with [kmk](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/main/docs/en/Getting_Started.md).
Does exactly what you would expect a keyboard to do, along with some handy functions(Not yet tested, but I am pretty sure they are gonna be helpful)
